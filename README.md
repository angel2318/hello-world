# hello-world
just another repository
Hello people!! I'm very excited to learn to code. It's something that I always wanted to do so maybe in the future I can be able to create apps for mobile devices or anything I put my mind to. I know that this world of programming is filled with very friendly people( and smart) and I just hope that I can be able to learn from everyone , and in the end be able to help others.
